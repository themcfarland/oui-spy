# OUI-SPY

![OUI-SPY](ouispy.png)

**ESP32-S3 based multi-mode detection system with integrated buzzer and power management.**

This board has sick PCB art. Available on [colonelpanic.tech](https://colonelpanic.tech) - Ready-to-use, no additional components required.

> **All current firmware is passive and detection-only.** Nothing transmitted, nothing exploited — just listening. This is the **Blue Edition** (defensive/recon). A **Red Edition** with offensive capabilities is in development and will be released separately. Stay tuned.

## Firmware Options

### [OUI-SPY Unified Blue](https://github.com/colonelpanichacks/oui-spy-unified-blue) ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**All four modes in one firmware — select from a boot menu, reboot, and go.**

One flash, four capabilities. The unified build combines Detector, Foxhunter, Flock-You, and Sky Spy into a single firmware with a WiFi-based boot selector. No reflashing needed to switch modes.

- **Boot selector** on AP `oui-spy` / `ouispy123` at `192.168.4.1`
- **Hold BOOT button** 2 seconds to return to the selector from any mode
- **MAC randomization** on every boot for privacy
- **Global buzzer toggle** from the selector menu
- **Distinct boot sounds** per mode — each plays its own retro tune so you know which firmware you're in
- **Persistent mode selection** — remembers your last choice across power cycles
- **Configurable AP** — change the selector SSID/password from the web UI

Includes all features from the standalone firmwares below, plus GPS wardriving in Flock-You mode, session persistence to flash, KML export for Google Earth, and a prior session history tab.

**Use Cases:** Everything. Flash once, switch modes on the fly.

### [OUI-SPY Unified Blue — Luke Switzer's fork](https://github.com/lukeswitz/oui-spy-unified-blue)

**Downstream fork of Unified Blue with a modular engine runtime, BLE GATT control, ESP-NOW mesh, and a Flutter companion app.**

A heavily refactored build by [Luke Switzer](https://github.com/lukeswitz). Same board, same four modes, but the firmware is rebuilt around an engine registry with proper WiFi mutual-exclusion, and a paired mobile app drives it over BLE GATT instead of (or alongside) the captive portal.

**Firmware additions:**
- Engine-registry runtime — detector / flock_wifi / flock_ble / foxhunter / skyspy / wardrive / unipwn engines start and stop independently, with mutual exclusion enforced between the WiFi engines
- BLE GATT control surface — configure and switch modes from the phone without joining the AP
- ESP-NOW mesh — coordinate multiple OUI-SPYs in range
- Captive portal DNS on every AP mode
- XIAO ESP32-C5 variant (`xiao-c5` branch) for dual-band 5 GHz scanning
- 5 GHz Remote ID test transmitter (`rid-test-tx-c5/`) for validating Sky-Spy on C5 hardware
- Atomic SPIFFS session persistence (copy+delete instead of the unreliable rename)

**Companion app (Android shipping, iOS in development):**
- Live detection feed with per-device details, actions, and one-tap copy of MAC, vendor, and location
- Geofence exclusion zones to silence detections in known areas
- Device and OUI ignore lists
- Map view with multiple tile styles, OUI CSV lookup, and full Flock-You vendor table
- Wardrive stats and per-session logs with detection counts
- Local notifications and iOS Live Activities for background alerts
- Prebuilt Android APK in [`companion/dist/`](https://github.com/lukeswitz/oui-spy-unified-blue/tree/companion/companion/dist)

**Use Cases:** Same as Unified Blue, with a phone-based control plane. The C5 variant adds 5 GHz coverage for next-gen Remote ID transmitters.
