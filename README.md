# OUI-SPY

![OUI-SPY](ouispy.png)

**ESP32-S3 based multi-mode detection system with integrated buzzer and power management.**

This board has sick PCB art. Available on [colonelpanic.tech](https://colonelpanic.tech) - Ready-to-use, no additional components required.

> **All current firmware is passive and detection-only.** Nothing transmitted, nothing exploited — just listening. This is the **Blue Edition** (defensive/recon). A **Red Edition** with offensive capabilities is in development and will be released separately. Stay tuned.

## Firmware Options

### [OUI-SPY Unified Blue](https://github.com/colonelpanichacks/oui-spy-unified-blue) ⭐ RECOMMENDED

**All four modes in one firmware — select from a boot menu, reboot, and go.**

**Flash from your browser:** [colonelpanichacks.github.io/oui-spy-unified-blue](https://colonelpanichacks.github.io/oui-spy-unified-blue/)

One flash, four capabilities. The unified build combines Detector, Foxhunter, Flock-You, and Sky Spy into a single firmware with a WiFi-based boot selector. No reflashing needed to switch modes.

- **Boot selector** on AP `oui-spy` / `ouispy123` at `192.168.4.1`
- **Hold BOOT button** 2 seconds to return to the selector from any mode
- **MAC randomization** on every boot for privacy
- **Global buzzer toggle** from the selector menu
- **Distinct boot sounds** per mode — each plays its own retro tune so you know which firmware you're in
- **Persistent mode selection** — remembers your last choice across power cycles
- **Configurable AP** — change the selector SSID/password from the web UI

Includes all features from the standalone firmwares below, plus GPS wardriving in Flock-You mode, session persistence to flash, KML export for Google Earth, and a prior session history tab.

**Use Cases:** Everything. Flash once, switch modes on the fly.

## Hardware Specifications

- **MCU:** ESP32-S3 dual-core processor
- **Connectivity:** WiFi 802.11n, Bluetooth 5.0, BLE
- **Audio:** Integrated buzzer with PWM control
- **Power:** USB-C powered with efficient power management
- **Antenna:** Built-in antenna with option for external directional antenna
- **Form Factor:** Compact PCB design optimized for portable use

## Quick Start

1. **Purchase** your OUI-SPY board from [colonelpanic.tech](https://colonelpanic.tech)
2. **Flash the [Unified Blue](https://github.com/colonelpanichacks/oui-spy-unified-blue) firmware** — one flash, all four modes
3. **Power on** and connect to WiFi AP `oui-spy` / password `ouispy123`
4. **Select your mode** from the web selector at `http://192.168.4.1`
5. **Device reboots** into your chosen mode — hold BOOT 2s to return to menu anytime

### AP credentials per mode

Each mode brings up its own access point with its own credentials. After a
mode switch you are joining a **different** network, not the selector AP.

| Mode | SSID | Password | Dashboard |
|------|------|----------|-----------|
| **Boot Selector** | `oui-spy` | `ouispy123` | `192.168.4.1` |
| **Detector** | `snoopuntothem` | `astheysnoopuntous` | `192.168.4.1` |
| **Foxhunter** | `foxhunter` | `foxhunter` | `192.168.4.1` |
| **Flock-You BLE** | `flockyou` | `flockyou123` | `192.168.4.1` |
| **Flock-You WiFi** | *none* | — | USB-CDC + Flask dashboard |
| **Sky Spy** | *none* | — | serial JSON output only |

Selector, Detector, and both Flock-You APs are changeable from their web UI
and persist to NVS. Foxhunter is fixed.

> **Can't load `192.168.4.1` after joining?** On Android, a network with no
> internet gets deprioritised and your browser traffic goes out over mobile
> data instead. Turn mobile data off, or accept the "stay connected" prompt.
>
> **Says the password is wrong?** If you previously joined an AP with the
> same SSID under different credentials, your phone is retrying the saved
> one. Forget the network and rejoin.
